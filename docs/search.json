    "text": "Modern professional international and top-league cricket is a high-stakes business. Teams invest heavily in players through contracts, auctions, training programs, overseas tours, and long-term development pipelines. A single decision to back the wrong player can cost millions of dollars and years of lost competitive advantage.\nCricket leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), Big Bash League (BBL), and The Hundred operate in multi-million-dollar ecosystems. In the 2026 IPL mini-auction alone, franchises spent over USD 26 million on 77 players, many of whom were young and relatively unproven (Hindustan Times 2026). These investments are made long before a player’s true long-term value is known.\nAt the center of all these decisions lies a difficult question: how do teams identify which young player has the growth potential to become a future star? When teams get this wrong, the consequences extend beyond finances. Poor choices affect team balance and long-term planning."
